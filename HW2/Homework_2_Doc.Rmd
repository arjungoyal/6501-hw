Question 3.1 

Using the same data set (credit_card_data.txt or credit_card_data-headers.txt) as in Question 2.2, use the ksvm or kknn function to find a good classifier:
(a)	using cross-validation (do this for the k-nearest-neighbors model; SVM is optional); and
(b)	splitting the data into training, validation, and test data sets (pick either KNN or SVM; the other is optional).
